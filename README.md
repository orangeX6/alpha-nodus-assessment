## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Yarn installed on your computer. If you don't have it yet, you can download it from the official website: https://yarnpkg.com/

## Install via npm

It is recommended to install Yarn through the npm package manager, which comes bundled with Node.js when you install it on your system.

Once you have npm installed you can run the following both to install and upgrade Yarn:
```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

Once you have Yarn installed, you can clone this repository and navigate to the project folder:
Then, install the project's dependencies using Yarn:
```bash
yarn
```

## Running the Project
To run the project, use the following command:
```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server and open the project in your default web browser. If the project is not opened by default go to http://localhost:5173/

You can now start editing the project's source files and see your changes live in the browser. The project uses Vite's fast hot module replacement (HMR) feature, so you don't need to refresh the page to see your changes.

## Building for Production

To build the project for production, use the following command:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will create a production-ready build of the project in the dist folder. You can then deploy this folder to your web server or hosting provider.
